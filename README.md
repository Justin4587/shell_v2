# SEA SHELL

Sea Shell is a simple command line interpreter that takes user commands, matches
    them with kernel functions and system calls, executes them, and returns to
    the prompt to request another command.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

Sea Shell was designed for use on Linux Ubuntu systems running on a 32-bit
    kernel.  While it may still be functional on other operating systems, it has
    not, and most likely will not,
    be tested for use with other kernels.

AUTHORS

Authorship for this shell is attributed to Ryan Devlin and Justin Thurman, as
    stated in the AUTHORS, but it is widely known to actually have been written
    by Okie Squatch.

BUG REPORTING

All bugs may be reported to areyoukidding@itsjustaschoolproject.org.

LICENSE

Free to use, but not even a hermit crab would want to live in this shell
permenantly.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Special shout out to Kelsie Merchant, who helped pull our chestnuts out of the
	fire right before the deadline.
